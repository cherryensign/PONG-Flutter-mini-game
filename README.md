# Pong - mini game

A mini game developed in Flutter and Dart.
The game has animations, score counter, start screen, hints, pause screen, gestures, etc.

Secret: You cannot beat the enemy! it's coded like that!ðŸ¤«ðŸ¤­

It's actually based on a pong game project developed by Mitch Koko on which he provided a tutorial on his youtube channel. I have took this project futher ahead by adding more components like start,hint, pause screen, etc.
Special Credits: Link to his project tutorial on YoutubeðŸ‘‡
